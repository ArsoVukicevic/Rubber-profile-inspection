# Rubber-profile-inspection

Proposed procedure for the dimensional inspection of extruded rubber profiles includes the following steps: 1) image acquisition, 2) system calibration, 3) profile segmentation, 4) landmark registration and 5) augmentation of the referent technical drawing over the acquired image. The solution was developed by using a single camera, allowing an operator to make the final decision with respect to his observations.
