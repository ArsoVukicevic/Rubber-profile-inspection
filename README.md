# Rubber-profile-inspection

Demo code of the research paper Arso M Vukicevic, Marko Djapan, Petar Todorovic, Milan EriÄ‡, Miladin Stefanovic, Ivan Macuzic. Decision Support System for Dimensional Inspection of Extruded Rubber Profiles. IEEE Access. Vol. 7, pp. 112605-112616, DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934561.

Proposed procedure for the dimensional inspection of extruded rubber profiles includes the following steps: 
1) image acquisition, 
2) system calibration, 
3) profile segmentation, 
4) landmark registration, and 
5) augmentation of the referent technical drawing over the acquired image. 

The solution was developed by using a single camera, allowing an operator to make the final decision with respect to his observations.

The code was writen in Matlab 2019b (run the 'DemoCode/arsGomaGUI.m' script).

Instructions for demo-GUI are available in video 'Demo video/DemoGomaMP4.mp4'.
